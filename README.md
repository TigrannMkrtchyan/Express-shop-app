# Tools and Middleware Used

## body-parser

body-parser is a middleware that parses the request body and makes it available under the req.body property. This is essential for handling JSON and URL-encoded data from POST and PUT requests.

## cors

cors is a middleware that enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in the application. It allows defining which origins are permitted to access the server's resources, thus enhancing security for client-server communication.

## morgan

morgan is a logging middleware that generates detailed request logs. It provides various logging formats, including 'combined' which logs the IP, date, request method, URL, status code, and response size.

## winston

winston is a versatile logging library that supports multiple transports (outputs). In the setup, two transport options are used: console output and log files. Different log levels (e.g., 'info', 'error') can be specified for each transport.

## helmet

helmet is a collection of security middleware functions that help secure Express applications by setting various HTTP headers. These headers mitigate common security vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS), content sniffing, and more.

## csurf

csurf is a middleware that provides Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection by adding a CSRF token to requests. It helps prevent unauthorized actions by requiring clients to include this token in their requests.

## cookie-parser

cookie-parser is a middleware that parses HTTP cookies and makes them available in the req.cookies object. This is useful for handling cookies sent by the client

## bcrypt

bcrypt is a library used for hashing passwords securely. It helps in protecting user passwords by applying a one-way hash function, making it difficult for attackers to reverse-engineer the original password from the hash.

## JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties. It's commonly used for authentication and authorization purposes. JWTs consist of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature, which can be used to securely transmit information between parties.

## Multer

Multer is a middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is typically used for uploading files. It makes it easy to handle file uploads on the server, process the files, and store them in a designated location.
